/// App-lifetime durable queue that re-attempts activity uploads that did not
/// reach the server during recording.
///
/// A finished activity is always persisted locally first (GPX + metadata) with
/// an `pending`/`failed` upload status. This queue scans for those records and
/// drains them, so an activity recorded with no connectivity is uploaded later
/// without the user having to open the history screen and tap retry.
///
/// Triggers:
/// - app-resume (wired in `app.dart`),
/// - optionally a `connectivitySignal` that emits `true` when connectivity is
///   restored. The signal is intentionally an injected `Stream` so the app
///   stays dependency-free; a build that wants connectivity-driven draining can
///   pass a stream (e.g. from `connectivity_plus`) without changing this class.
/// - optionally a backoff retry: when `retryBackoff` is non-empty and a drain
///   leaves records failed, another drain is scheduled after the next delay in
///   the list (the last delay repeats). This covers a server that becomes
///   reachable without any connectivity change the OS reports, e.g. a VPN or
///   tailnet route coming back while the device stays online. Timers only fire
///   while the process runs, so this complements, not replaces, the triggers
///   above.
///
/// [drain] is single-flight: concurrent calls share the same in-progress run,
/// so app-resume and a connectivity event cannot start two overlapping drains.
